==================
The request object
==================


Ophelia's request object is both used for processing the request as the HTTP
server needs to obtain a response, and accessed by user code to use the
current traversal state and influence how the request will be further
processed. Accordingly, a request object provides two interfaces, IRequestAPI
meant to be exposed to user code, and IRequestTraversal specifying the
traversal mechanism:

    >>> from ophelia.interfaces import IRequestAPI, IRequestTraversal
    >>> from ophelia.request import Request

    >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
    >>> verifyClass(IRequestAPI, Request)
    True
    >>> verifyClass(IRequestTraversal, Request)
    True
