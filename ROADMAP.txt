Roadmap
=======

This document is to outline the defining features of Ophelia releases. It is
not about schedules; Ophelia will be released whenever it is ready.

Except for the 0.x series, API backwards compatibility within each major
release series will be given. New features start new x.y series while bug
fixes give rise to maintenance x.y.z releases.

Many of the following ideas might be implemented in separate packages that
might share the ophelia namespace, rather than in the core.


0.5
===

- split the request object into request, response and a handler
- a more powerful traversal mechanism
- a concept for error handling
- several backwards-incompatible clean-ups
- improved factoring and test coverage


post-0.5
========

- views and traversers for using Ophelia inside Zope3 and Grok applications
- a syntax checker for input files
- a tool for including content from Restructured Text files
- RSS reading done right
- use more Zope technology: i18n, content providers, events, local components
- more flexible input system, real integration of ReST, possibly image views
- directory listings
- internal caching of processed information, especially when using docutils
- data sources outside the file system, such as http or vcs resources


Further ideas
=============

- zero-boilerplate creation of web sites including

  * hand-written XHTML pages, other input mark-up such as ReST
  * pages generated from JPEG, PNG and PDF files
  * overviews such as photo albums

- flexible, little-overhead navigation infrastructure

- straight-forward form submission infrastructure

- interfaces to let other web frameworks (e.g. the Zope publisher or Pyramid)
  do part of the content generation, both calling them from inside Ophelia
  content and providing means to call Ophelia from their code

- cataloging, local search infrastructure (maybe using xapian or solr)
