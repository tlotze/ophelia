Roadmap
=======

This document is to outline the defining features of Ophelia releases. It is
not about schedules; Ophelia will be released whenever it is ready.

At any time, bug fixes and features needed for particular web sites will go in
whichever x.y.z releases require them, as well as maintainance releases of any
later x.y releases.

Except for the 0.x series, API backwards compatibility within each major
release series will be given.


0.1
---

The state in which Ophelia is able to host www.thomas-lotze.de for the first
time, whatever the feature set and code quality.

0.2
---

A much cleaned-up version of the 0.1 state, with a feed tool added. This
hadn't been a planned release but there were so many changes while preparing
for WSGI integration that releasing them as 0.2 first seemed like the obvious
thing to do.

0.3
---

Internal usage of WSGI, zc.buildout based distribution.

0.4
---

A JPEG handler that builds pages from JPEG files which display the image along
with comments and some EXIF data.

1.0
---

The state in which the wishlist has been implemented completely for the first
time and code and documentation are of satisfactory quality.

The wishlist:

- zero-boilerplate creation of web sites inlcuding
  * hand-written XHTML pages
  * pages generated from JPEG, PNG and PDF files
  * overviews such as photo albums

- flexible, little-overhead navigation infrastructure

- straight-forward form submission infrastructure

- internals following the WSGI standard, connecting to
  * Apache/mod_python
  * Twisted Web
  * CGI
  * CLI-based converter to static files

- cataloging, local search infrastructure
