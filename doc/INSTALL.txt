Prerequisites
=============

- Apache2
- Python 2.3 or better
- mod_python 3.1 or better
- the zope package from Zope3


Installation
============

- copy the ophelia package into the system Python path or configure
  mod_python's Python path according to where you put the ophelia package

- if you don't have the zope package installed system-wide, put it in
  mod_python's Python path as well

- choose a DocumentRoot, TemplateRoot, and maybe python path for your site's
  files, and configure Apache accordingly (see below)

- cause Apache to reload its configuration


Example Apache 2 configuration
------------------------------

Assuming you put everything belonging to your site under a common directory,
$SITE_PATH, add the following to your host's config:

<Directory $SITE_PATH/DocumentRoot>
           PythonPath "['$SITE_PATH/python'] + sys.path"
           PythonOption DocumentRoot $SITE_PATH/DocumentRoot
           PythonOption TemplateRoot $SITE_PATH/TemplateRoot
           AddHandler mod_python .html
           PythonHandler ophelia.apache |.html
           PythonDebug On
</Directory>

The PythonOption DocumentRoot is optional; it defaults to Apache's
DocumentRoot setting.


Issues
======

Directory indexes
-----------------

* index page: touch index.html so the handler is fired on the file name
* automatic index: touch all files to be listed that are built by templating
